| **NFTC-001 (Positive)** | **Pop-up Response Time (Performance)** | Verify that the pop-up (alert or modal) appears without noticeable delay, ensuring a quick and smooth user experience upon clicking the button. | 1. Open the page in a standard browser. 2. Use a performance monitoring tool or simply observe the response time. 3. Click the **"Click here"** button once. 4. **Expected Result:** The pop-up appears instantaneously (e.g., within 500ms) after the click, with no visible lag. |
| **NFTC-002 (Positive)** | **UI Responsiveness Across Devices (Usability)** | Verify that the **"Click here"** button remains correctly positioned, scaled, and fully clickable on different screen sizes and device orientations (desktop, tablet, mobile). | 1. Open the page on a desktop browser. 2. Resize the browser window from maximum width down to a mobile resolution (e.g., 320px). 3. Test on a mobile device/emulator and switch between portrait and landscape modes. 4. **Expected Result:** The button is visible, does not overlap other elements, and is fully functional (clickable) at all tested screen sizes and orientations. |
| **NFTC-003 (Positive)** | **Keyboard Accessibility of Button (Accessibility)** | Verify that the **"Click here"** button can be successfully accessed and triggered using keyboard navigation alone, ensuring compliance with basic accessibility standards. | 1. Open the page and ensure the focus is not on the button. 2. Use the **Tab** key to navigate through interactive elements until the focus lands on the **"Click here"** button. 3. Press the **Enter** or **Space** key. 4. **Expected Result:** The pop-up with the message **"You have clicked the button"** appears immediately upon pressing Enter or Space. |

Rapidly click the **"Click here"** button 5-10 times in quick succession. 3. **Expected Result (For Alert):** Only one browser alert is queued and displayed, or if using a modal, only a single modal appears/updates without generating script errors. The page remains responsive after dismissing the pop-up(s). |
| **NFTC-005 (Non-Functional)** | **Font and Color Contrast (Usability/Accessibility)** | Verify that the text label **"Click here"** on the button has sufficient color contrast against its background and is clearly legible according to WCAG guidelines. | 1.
