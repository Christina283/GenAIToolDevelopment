        Title: Display a pop-up message when the "Click here" button is clicked

        As a user,
        I want to click a button labeled "Click here"
        So that a pop-up appears with the message "You have clicked the button"

        Acceptance Criteria:
        A button labeled "Click here" is displayed on the page.
        When the user clicks the button, a pop-up (alert) appears.
        The pop-up displays the exact text: "You have clicked the button".
        The pop-up can be dismissed by the user.

        Notes:

        The pop-up can be implemented using a browser alert or a modal dialog.
        The button should be visible and clickable on all standard screen sizes.

Instructions
